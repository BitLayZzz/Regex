Q4: Write a regex that matches any line of text that contains nothing but a URL. 
For this exercise, a URL begins with http:// or http://, and continues until it

  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox

  https://user.example.com/test.cgi?a=p&c=0&t=0&g=0 hello
       http://launchschool.com/
There should be two matches

A4: /^https?:\/\/\S+$/


Q5: Modify your regex from the previous exercise so the URL can have optional leading
or trailing whitespace, but is otherwise on a line by itself. To test your regex with
trailing whitespace, you must add some spaces to the end of some lines in your sample
text.

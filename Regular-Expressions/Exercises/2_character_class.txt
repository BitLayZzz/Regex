  Kitchen Kaboodle
  Reds and blues
  kitchen Servers
6 matches

A1: /[Kks]/


Q2: Write a regex that matches any of the strings cat, cot, cut, bat, bot, or but,
  regardless of case. Test with the following:

9 matches

A2:
  /[bc][aou]t/i


Q3: Base 20 digits include the decimal digits 0 and 9, and the letters A through J
  in upper or lowercase. Write a regex that matches base 20 digits.
  Test it with these strings:
  0xDEADBEEF
  1234.5678
  Jamaica
  plow ahead
There should be 28 matches

A3: /[0-9A-Ja-j]/

Q4: Write a regex that matches any letter except x or X.
  Test it with these strings:
  0x1234
  Too many XXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXX to count.
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
There should be 82 matches.

A4: /[a-wyz]/i


Q5: Why is /[^x]/i not a valid answer to the previous exercise?

A5: The previous regex would include all non-alphabetic characters as well.


Q6: Write a regex that matches any character that is not a letter.
Test it with these strings:

A6: /[^a-z]/i


Q7: Are /(ABC|abc)/ and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex?

A7: No the output of the 1st regex will be either all caps or all lowercase
   where as the 2nd regex will have more variation in the case.
   8 different possibilities I believe


Q8: Are /abc/i and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex?

A8: No, the output of the first regex will, again be either all caps or no lowercase.
   The other will be more dynamic.


Q9: Challenge: write a regex that matches a string that look like a simple negated
  character class range, e.g [^a-z].
  (Your answer should match precisely six characters.)
  Test with these strings:
  The regex /[^a-z]/i matches any character that is
  not a letter. Similarly, /[^0-9]/ matches any
  non-digit while /[^A-Z]/ matches any character
  that is not an uppercase letter. Beware: /[^+-<]/
  is at best obscure, and may even be wrong.
There should be three matches.

A9: /\[\^[0-9a-z]-[0-9a-z]\]/i

  text:
    Doc in a big red box.
    Hup! 2 3 4
  Why did we get the results we did?

A2: Doc wasn't picked up because there is no whitespace before the pattern,
  red because?
  box wasn't picked up becasue a . is followed.
  Hup! wasn't picked up becasue it is a 4 character regex.

  before and after the regex
